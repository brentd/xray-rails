  # Patterns for the kind of JS constructors Xray is interested in knowing the

  #   MyView = Backbone.View.extend({ ...

  # Returns augmented JS source where constructors Xray wants to know the
  # filepath of are captured in such a way that at runtime, xray.js can look
  # up a view constructor's filepath and name.
  #
  # This:
  #   MyView = Backbone.View.extend({ ...
  #
  # Becomes:
  #   MyView = (window.XrayPaths||(window.XrayPaths={}))['{"name":"MyView","path":"/path/to/file.js"}'] = Backbone.View.extend({ ...
  #
  # A goal here was to not add any new lines to the source so as not to throw
  # off line numbers if an exception is thrown, hence the odd pattern of
  # abusing an object set operation in a multiple assignment.
  #
  # TODO: This is simple and gets the job done, but is a bit ridiculous.
  #       I've also seen this appear in stack traces :( Would love to find a
  #       way to do this without actually writing to the files.
